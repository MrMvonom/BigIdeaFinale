    "# Transportation \n",
    "### By Benediktus Darrel Djunaidi\n",
    "\n",
    "Transportation includes all modes of transport that individuals use to travel from one place to another. Without it, transport may be impossible in select neighborhoods which makes it impossible for the public to commute for: daily activities such as work, school, buying groceries, and other important things.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, **work** is something that is essential in today's world; businesses can only operate if we have people who can commute and work. Hence, I have chosen **transportation** as a submetric to determining the best Pittsburgh neighborhood(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, the difficulty of selecting a metric is from the *availability of data*. In order to analyze data of neighborhoods and determine the winner(s), the dataset must have a field that includes the names of the neighborhoods, otherwise it would be impossible to relate any neighborhood to any data values. It was difficult trying to find a dataset which included reasonable metrics that is fully (or at least, mostly) complete."

    "- Preference - people may prefer using cars more than using other modes of transport, such as bicycling and walking.\n",
    "- Population - there could be less population in a neighborhood, therefore skewing the measurements to become better than they would be in real terms (when compared to other neighborhoods by making up for the population difference).\n",
    "- Natural Environment - environmental factors in a seemingly \"good\" neighborhood may be comparatively worse to a neighborhood with \"worse\" records of commuter data."

    "### Measurement\n",
    "There are a lot more reasons why this data alone will not suffice. So, to make up for the possible inaccuracies in decision-making, we will create **the ultimate measurement**, using the current data, to determine the quality of a neighborhood. Since the data we have is very limited, I chose three fields to be incorporated that I think are the most definitive of the \"best\" neighborhood: **total working population**, **use of cars**, and **use of public transportation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the formula of the measurement that I came up with is as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "$M = \\frac{C + 1.25T}{2}\\times\\frac{P}{H}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M$ = measure, $C$ = use of cars, $T$ = use of public transportation, $P$ = total working population, and $H$ = highest total working population in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bigger $M$ is, the \"better\" the neighborhood will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Derivation\n",
    "*Note: clearly, this is an unprofessional, largely intuition-based approach on creating the formula without any efforts to explore the relationships of such factors in the real world. Therefore, this is only an estimation and may be absolutely inaccurate.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Public transportation** and the **use of cars** are important and significant in determining the \"best\" Pittsburgh neighborhood. However, since public transport is more accessible to the less fortunate as opposed to cars, I attached a 1.25 multiplier to emphasize its significance, while taking the average of both to compute a single number for comparability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Population** also affects the degree to which a neighborhood is the \"best\". If there is less population, the possibility of a neighborhood ranking higher than another may be more frequent, as there would be less occurrences of factors that degrade a neighborhood's quality, vice versa. In order to create a fair playing ground among all neighborhoods with varying population sizes, I included the ratio of the total working population and the highest total working population in the dataset. This in turn should create a more equal field among the rest as this creates a nature of direct proportionality where a smaller population size would be met with a lower measurement figure."

Hence, even with the improved measurement derived by using data from only this dataset, there is still the possibility of having inaccuracies. Therefore, we hope that combining these results with the other submetrics' results will increase its precision."
